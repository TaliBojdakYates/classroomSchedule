# Classroom Schedule Webite
A student of Illinois Institute of Technology would be able enter a building name and classroom number to find out if there are classes being held in that room so they could hold study groups there when there are no classes

The main page of the website has the same style as the schools website to offer easy integration and use

The classroom schedule website has two main pages. One page is for when the classroom is found and there are classes. Here it gives a list the classes in that room and the time that they are so a student can go into the this room when there are no classes. The second page is when a classroom exists but there are no classes being held.
