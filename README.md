# Classroom Schedule Webite
A student of Illinois Institute of Technology would be able enter a building name and classroom number to find out if there are classes being held in that room so they could hold study groups there when there are no classes

The main page of the website has the same style as the schools website to offer easy integration and use

The classroom schedule website has two main pages. One page is for when the classroom is found and there are classes. Here it gives a list the classes in that room and the time that they are so a student can go into the this room when there are no classes. The second page is when a classroom exists but there are no classes being held.

This website also handles user error if they enter a classroom that does not exist. If this happens a pop up appears to let the user know they made a mistake.

The website also connects to a MySQL data base which holds a list of all the classes and the times that they happen. This is a mok data base with data for Monday. More data could be added for the other days. The code is currently hardcoded to be set on monday, but if more classroom data for different days was imputed different classes would show up depending on the day.
